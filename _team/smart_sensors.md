Smart sensors are a combination of electronic and software technologies that provide new kind of information. 
The recent massive growth of artificial intelligence and data science provide easy to handle tools for the software development. 
At the same time educational electronics mainly driven by global players (Raspberry, Arduino, Adafruit, â€¦) simplify the hardware part. The combination of
 both is useless in chemistry if we do not add chemical knowledge. The possibility of understanding if a sensor provides valuable information is combined with the deep 
 knowledge of the phenomenon monitored. Our aim is to provide this valuable chemical part in the development of interesting new sensors.
