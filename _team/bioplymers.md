Biopolymers are the last frontier of polymer science. They come from the need to use new green raw materials and from the need to make
 the plastic itself degradable. However, as people experienced the new materials must maintain acceptable performance and cost.
 These are very though challenges for the chemists because new synthesis methods and processes need to be developed. 
 The increased variability of the new raw materials and narrow variability of the performance push both in the adoption of continuous, 
dedicated, and controlled production. The combination of all these properties is where we are very interested.
