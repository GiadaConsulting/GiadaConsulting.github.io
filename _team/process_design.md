Process design is a common activity done by the chemical engineers. However, new changes modified the paradigms of this activity. 
Globalization, green economy, public funds, political instability, etc. modify the value of the chemicals and the energy. Traditional
 postulates are modified, and new possibilities are available. Process design need to continuously update and become a flexible tool. 
 Since plants and facilities are not flexible and adaptable by themselves, a human vision must combine them in a smart way. Our interest
 is to review process design with the objective to make it the most adaptable as possible.
