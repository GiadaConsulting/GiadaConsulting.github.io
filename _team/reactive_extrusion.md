Extruders are equipment commonly used in polymer processing. However, they are suitable also for polymer synthesis from monomers. Of course, there are limitations, but the possibilities are increased by the flexibility of extruder constructions. Why extruder is convenient?
• It runs continuously, so the productivity is high.
• The weight of monomers is much lower than the weight of the extruder, so the thermal control is easy and the safety high.
• The temperature profile can be easily modulated along the process.
• Extruder sector can be configured to have different residence time and mixing conditions.
• The solvent required is at minimum.
