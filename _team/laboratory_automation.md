Automation is growing fast and anywhere. But chemical laboratory automation is not so fast and widespread. Probably, the market is not enough broad to provide projects and solutions.
Another possibility is the fact that chemical laboratories have diversified initiative that need flexible and easily adaptable systems not yet available in automation.
Meanwhile, we believe that initiatives developed for home automation can be adapted to laboratory works. Customization must be made by yourself but the last proposals for the home are very easy to lean and implement even for unskillful people in electronic. We tried to develop some data acquisition and process engineering with combined configuration of hardware and software parts.
