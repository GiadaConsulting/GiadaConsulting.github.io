Plastics are the most common materials in environmental pollution, as it is well known. Several techniques are used to recover and reuse them. Or interest follows in the chemical recycling, i.e. in the way to depolymerize them back to their monomers. Not all the polymers are suitable for this technology, but methyl methacrylate and polyethylene terephthalate they are. Several processes are under scrutiny to find the optimal reuse with the lower energy consumption. We are involved in a couple of these routes.
