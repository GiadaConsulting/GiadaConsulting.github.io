Process data are sensors readings (temperature, pressure, flow, level, â€¦) coming from the control system (PLC or DCS). For each lot produced, you get several sequences of numbers at the same time (trajectories or Time Series). Practically, each production provides a table of data. If you need to check the quality of plant though the data provided by many lots, you must face the problem of combining all their tables.
You cannot simply put all the data together because each lot is characterized by different durations and tables consequently have different length. This opens the problem of trajectory synchronization. Literature repots several techniques none of them perfect. The best way is to apply each of them and see which is suitable for your process. This comparison is facilitated if a specific software is available. Our interest is to provide an easy tool for this purpose.
