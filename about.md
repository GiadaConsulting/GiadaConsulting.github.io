Founders of Giada Consulting decided to start activities moved by two main reasons.

* The first reason comes from our observation that more and more people that have a large knowledge in chemistry tend to keep it theoretical and abstract. 
Vice versa people involve in practical activities are less and less interested in understand what they are doing. This is reasonable since a lot of external limitations (bureaucracy, 
rules, guarantees, etc.) discourage the practical activities and the waste availability of information, theories and opinion overload a simple and defined understanding. 
So, we believe to merge the two options in spite to all the difficulties keeping our activities practical and knowledgeable. Of course, we do not know if we are able to follow this 
guideline but at least we try and we do our best. Just to remind it adopted the slogan **"Knowledge in Action"**.


* The second reason comes from another observation related to the chemical market. Nowadays, the market is absolutely driven by the business. Noting to say about the dominance of the 
business since the duty of each company is making profit. However, we have some concern about the word "absolutely". In fact, when things are going well, they confirm a good business 
strategy, but when something goes wrong, then a **"Black Shawn"** arrived. But quite often the Shawn is just a phenomenon and is not even black because is clearly written in a paper. 
We mean that a business debacle in the chemical market is simply caused by  a well-known chemical effect. We understand that for a non-chemical people something that is not understood 
could be interpret like a mysterious animal... If you would like to test our notes have a look to the

and see how business gurus have sometime a below average college knowledge in analytical chemistry.
Based on this observation, the second guideline of our activity is to share and explain the potential impact that chemical information may have on the business and enlarge by them the possible strategic alternatives.
