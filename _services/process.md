The Process is in which way you make your production. If you are thinking about process it means you have already clear ideas abot synthesis, properties and applications. You already have follwoed the internal loop of Reasearch and Development and 
you are starting to play seriously the game. If this not the case, do not deal with process because you must have definite position of what, why and how make your product.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">Process decides all the operations and the sequences reqired for the productions. It involves a lot of decision regarding the kind of equipment, the time, the quality of raw materials and products and even thousands of parameters
such us temperature, pressure, residence time, flows, etc..The sequence of the operation is a key and understimate topic (see for instance the success of process intensification). To develop a good process you must master traditional engineering knowledge such as:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Unit operations</li>
  <li>Reactor design</li>
  <li>Phase and heat transfer</li>
  <li>Fluodynamic</li>
  <li>Thermochemistry</li>
  <li>Process Design</li>
</b></ul></p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
Due to the variety of choices and possibility, we can say that you never end up to make your process better. Changes in the cost of utilities, raw materials and logistic modify continously the scenario and the process need to be  updated.
It is surprising to see how many companies beleave that the process must never modified. Unfortunately, it is the quite often the key difference between gain and lost. We strongly beleave that processes need to be continously update depending
of the market conditions. The best processes are those that are designed to flexible and versatile.
