Control is is the whatchdog of your production. With Control we mean: electronic hardware (sensors, actuators, servos, etc.) and software (logic and code) in PLS and DCS. But not only! In the modern production, Control is much more since it provides
data and with them data analysis and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">A good control system not only minimizes losts and reduces the risk. A good control provides information and knowledge of your production and continously provides information for making 
your production more profitable. If data freely generated by the controllers are analysed with statistical and data analysis tools they sugget where are localized the costs, where the production cycles can be speed up and where energy 
and materials are wasted. Of course, this is not immediately evident but it will be clear after you applies the following skills:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MVA)</li>
  <li>Data Mining and aAnlysis (DA)</li>
  <li>Electronic and Sensors</li>
  <li>Networking and Data Handling</li>
  <li>Computer Science and Programming</li>
</b></ul></p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
The quantity of data generated by a chemical plant is impressive. However is not as big as expected. Even a rafinery with thousands of sensors that run contiously generates data that now are easily handled and stored.
The amount of information are useless if not immediately analysied with sofisticated techniques. We have a consolidated experience in data analysis for chemistry starting from the basic procedures given by the MVA to the most 
recent ones given by DA. The importance of this information is surprising high because it involve each step of the production and discover all the points of weackness and strenght.
