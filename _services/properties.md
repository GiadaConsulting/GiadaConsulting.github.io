<p style="font-size:22px">
Properties of a chemical product are measures that define its quality. Quality means value and this brings its importance. Measures are made by both chemical and physical tests. They include composition, purity, assay but also viscosity, conductivity, solubility, biodegradability, etc. To define the way the measures are made you must master:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Analytic Chemistry (including its branches: spectroscopy, chromatography, microscopy, etc.)</li>
  <li>Rheology</li>
  <li>Colloid Science</li>
  <li>Optics</li>
  <li>Physical Chemistry</li>
</b></ul></p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
Depending of the product, some are more important than other but very rarely they are limited to just one.
It seems obvious that better are the properties, higher is the value of the product and so the trend is defined. However, this is not always true. The goal is not always to reach the best quality but achieved the right quality. As an example, we can consider the purity of a chemical compound. Purification is commonly one of the most expensive steps in chemical production and its improvement means high cost. If the product has to be used in a sector that does not require high purity, purification must be limited. Knowing how the properties are influencing the use of the chemical becomes a way to improve your income.
A further example is given by the deep understanding of the range where some properties are required. Quite often, people measure properties in conditions far away from the real application conditions. Typical case is to measure the color of a product alone when it will be always mixed with other chemicals. Understanding the real reason that requires a property is not a secondary form of knowledge.</p>
