<p style="font-size:22px">
The Plant is where your product is made and your people are working. All tools from the big ones (reactors, columns, pipelines, tanks, driers) to the small ones (pumps, filters, compressors) make it the real value of the company.
Two main questions are involved: is the plant really realizing our process? Is the plant the safest for the people?</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">The first answer recall the ability of scaling-up the process, i.e. the reaction must goes independently of the amount produced. The second answer requires the respect of good manufacturing practices that minimize the risk. 
Again, a lot of different competences are required:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Dimesional Analysis</li>
  <li>Matematical Modelling</li>
  <li>Short cuts and rule of tumb tricks</li>
  <li>Software simulation ability</li>
  <li>Regulation and Certification</li>
  <li>Thermochemistry</li>
  <li>Applied Mechanics and Materials</li>
</b></ul></p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
More and more new devices and machineries are coming from different sources. Someones are new designed other are recovered from dismissing sites. Both they may represent a conveneient opportunity or severe danger for a new plant.
 The feelling that a new tool is good or bad must be predicted with reliability. Plants are not laboratories and each mistake involves a relevant lost of money. Experience and modeling are the two ways to base your decision.
