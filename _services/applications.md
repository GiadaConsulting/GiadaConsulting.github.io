Applications are the needs of the chemical compounds. In some markets, like pharma,  this is easy because the chemical structure is defined and you have not choices. However, in other markets the chemical structure is not defined because what it is important is the 
effect provided by the chemical compound. So, you to satisfy the application but the composition of your product is variable. This is quite common when you deal with formulations (mixtures of several chemical compounds) and polymers.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">In the later case, experience, networking and immagination are the key skills. You need to have adiversified experience in several industrial sectors and know how they work and what they need. More information you have achieved,
 more are the possible applications of the chemical compound. This is not a strict chemical knowledge because involved areas that are not driven by chemistry but they just need chemistry. Giada Consulting has direct and indirect knowledge in many industrial fields such as:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Cosmetic and detergecy</li>
  <li>Biochemistry and Food</li>
  <li>Paper, leather and textile industry</li>
  <li>Oil drilling and recovery</li>
  <li>Plastic recycling</li>
  <li>Metal working</li>
  <li>Coating and painting</li>
</b></ul></p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
Quite often, people do not realize that several sectors exactly use the same chemicals. Depending of the market the prices of the chemical is different and in many cases is not justified. Improving the market possibilities of your productins in areas you never though about, it is cheap and efficient.
Viceversa sometime the cost of upgrading your production to best priced market is required. The decision is consequently a trade-off between investement and revenus, but you need a qualified budget of the new routes. So, experience is still the best bet.
