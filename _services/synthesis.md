<p style="font-size:22px">
The Synthesis is the whole of actions that transforms ingredients or raw materials to the chemical product.
This pathway is not unique and in many causes several alternatives are possible. Finding the different possibilities and choosing the most convenient is the goal of the synthesis research.
Synthesis is the base of the business because it strongly influences all the rest. Skills needed to develop this part are the core of the chemical competences and can be listed in a quite long set:</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<ul><b>
  <li>Organic Chemistry</li>
  <li>Inorganic Chemistry</li>
  <li>Biochemistry</li>
  <li>Electrochemistry</li>
  <li>Polymer science</li>
  <li>Thermodynamic</li>
  <li>Kinetic</li>
  <li>Catalysis</li>
</b></ul></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Except the last three, the first depend of the kind of product you are going to produce and may or may not be required.
It seems obvious that each chemical business has a synthesis base. This can be either very complex (several steps, intermediate products, different unit operations) or very simple (such as a water dissolution of a salt). Less obvious is that base is unchangeable.
Especially in the last years, the market and mentality changes promoted a deep revision. Of course, changes are not in chemistry, but in the choice of what we consider an optimal or convenient pathway.
For instance, the requirement of “green raw materials” push more ecofriendly synthetic routes that in the past were considered inefficient.
The globalization, makes available raw materials at reduced cost that promotes shorter pathway starting from different substance. At the contrary globalization, stress the price of some ingredients that are not conveniently available or need to be produced on site instead of simply purchased.
After several year of slow motion, the Synthesis research needs to be update in a way that continuously adapts itself to the rapid changes. So, appropriate knowledge is required and recovered by the previous competences.</p>
